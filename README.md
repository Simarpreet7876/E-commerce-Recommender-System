# üõçÔ∏è E-commerce Product Recommender with LLM Explanations

This project is a complete e-commerce product recommendation system that provides personalized suggestions using a collaborative filtering model and generates human-like explanations for why an item is recommended using a local Large Language Model (LLM).
